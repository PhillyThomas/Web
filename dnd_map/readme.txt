This website contains a prototype for an online D&D map.

Currently it shows places of interest, including dungeons, towns, and roads. Towns also include shops and their inventories to assist expedition planning for players.

I'd like to add back-end functionality to connect to an SQL server to give the website the feel of an "MMO" map.
