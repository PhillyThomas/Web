This website contains a fully playable online version of the popular board game "Poetry for Neanderthals".

Website contains code to select number of players, and to also give each player a name. 
This code is disabled however, the game simply asks for the game mode and if a time limit should be imposed.
Might change it in the future to allow player customization, but it works fine for now.
